### Notebooks
- **Chapter_02_Fundamentals.ipynb**: Examples of key security metrics and their practical applications.
- **Chapter_11_Statistical_Analysis.ipynb**: Core statistical methods and their implementation in Python.
- **Chapter_12_Machine_Learning.ipynb**: Hands-on examples of machine learning techniques for cybersecurity analysis.
- **Chapter_13_Generative_AI.ipynb**: Use of generative AI to enhance cybersecurity analysis and reporting.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
1. **Python 3.8+**
2. **Jupyter Notebook**
3. Required Python libraries:
   - pandas
   - matplotlib
   - seaborn
   - scikit-learn
   - openai
   - statsmodels
   - keras (or tensorflow.keras)

### Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mariano215/Security_Metrics.git
```

Install the necessary Python packages using `pip`:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Notebooks

1. Navigate to the `notebooks` directory:
```bash
cd notebooks
```

2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

3. Open the desired notebook (e.g., `Chapter_11_Statistical_Analysis.ipynb`) and run the cells.

## Code Overview

Each notebook provides:
* Step-by-step explanations of the code
* Generated datasets (where applicable) to eliminate the need for external data
* Visualizations and summaries of results

**Note:** The `Chapter_13_Generative_AI.ipynb` notebook demonstrates how to use open-source tools like LM Studio and Ollama, as well as the OpenAI API, for analyzing cybersecurity metrics.
